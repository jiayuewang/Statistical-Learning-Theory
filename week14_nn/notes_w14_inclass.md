## intro to machine learning processes.
1. data collection
2. function space
	- linear
	  - univariate case (higher order)
	  - multivariate
	  	- COD
	  	- GAM (generalized additive model)
	- nonlinear model: SVM, tree models, model ensemble, model stacking.
	- neutral networks

3. loss function
 - hinge loss (for SVM)
 - Ntriepe
 - RMSE

4. optimization
  - deivative
  - gradient descent <appropriately settting the learning rate is important for gd method>
  - stochastic gradient descent
  - multi-dimension partial derivative <https://keras.io/optimizers/>
  - adamax; sgd; keras.io/optimizers

## Neural network.
1. concepts
  - a simple example
  - activation functions
    - sigmoid
    - tanh
    - ReLU
    - Leaky ReLU
    - Maxout
    - ELU
2. R implementaion <check the R file in the folder>
  - check the file.
3. Run r in aws
  - louis aws r
  - pick a gpu, with second column starts with p <20 cents/ hour>
  - http
  - copy the link at right bottom corner to the web server (top status column in R).
  - final test loss: 0.3722272; test accuracy: 0.8661

## critical thinking and critical writing <to the core>.
