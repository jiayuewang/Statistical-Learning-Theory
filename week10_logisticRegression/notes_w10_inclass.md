* project2 discussion
- Feel the continuous model like this. <keep training while testing>
- learn stl model (season + trend + randomness)
- Think about the four main holidays for improving the data.
- discover some more fitting models.

* concepts in P(x,y) = P(Y=y|X=x)*P(X=x)
P(x,y): Generative model
P(Y=y|X=x): discriminant model

* Logistic Regression. 
- why they define the loss function L(y, eta(x)) like that?
- gradient vectore vs. Hessian matrix

* non negative definition of Hessian matrix {convex}

* in OLS, how to choose eta(x) and in reality, how to select parameters (beta1, beta2, etc.)
hint: eta(x) ranges (0,1). The better means the larger (closer to 1).
