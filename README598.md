***This repo just includes those sample code that shows in CS 598 and My notes amd will contain my MPS' code after grading***

# Statistical learning theory


> Grading: The course grade for the class is broken down among the following items:

> Course Grading:
40%: 10 quizzes;
20%: 4 coding assignments;
40%: 4 mini projects.


**Badges will go here**

# CS  598 - Text

‚ÄúThe Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction‚Äù by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.
‚ÄúAn Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R‚Äù by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Slides, videos and solutions can be found here.

# CS  598 - What is ML Theory?
‚Ä¢ What is ML?
Machine learning adapts algorithms to data.
The definition broad because ML is not simply:
spam filtering; choosing treatments for illnesses; grouping genes by function.
ML is also (e.g., since neural nets are Turing complete!):
solving traveling salesman instances (with neural nets. . . I‚Äôm serious); playing go, chess,
DOTA. . . driving cars.
‚Ä¢ TCS is design and analysis of algorithms; ML Theory is design and analysis of ML algorithms.
We care about some of the same things you see in pure TCS: time complexity, space complexity,. . .
We also care about: sample complexity, label complexity, . . .
Remark 2.1. Machine learning excels at noisy data and handling the average case; by contrast, TCS often
focuses on the worst case, giving TSP hope here. ^
1
Remark 2.2. ML also cares about worst case; e.g., ‚Äúadversarial examples‚Äù. ^
‚Ä¢ Why ML Theory?
Optimistic application-oriented view of MLT:
Some ML algs and ideas had their origins in theory, even if they are used beyond the
theoretical analysis: sgd, adagrad, boosting, regularization, neural nets. . .
Pessimistic application-oriented view of MLT:
‚Äì Most ML algs, however, seem to have no involvement from theory (at any stage in their genesis).
This seems sad. Wouldn‚Äôt we like to say ‚Äúall this hard work gets us better algorithms‚Äù? So. . . why do
ML theory?
‚Äì We seek understanding. [ IMO, this is the reason for the increased recent interest in deep learning
theory. ]
‚Äì It can give a fresh look that leads to a new idea, even if the new idea isn‚Äôt fully backed by theory.
